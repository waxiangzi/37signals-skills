# 37signals Skills

Agent skills and a reference guide that teach AI coding assistants to write Rails the 37signals way — extracted from Fizzy, Campfire, and 100+ of DHH's code reviews.

> **Unofficial.** This is a community project based on 37signals' public code and discussions — not affiliated with or endorsed by 37signals.

Drop the skills into Claude Code or Cursor and your agent starts applying the same patterns 37signals uses: rich domain models over service objects, state as records, CRUD-everything routing, fixtures over factories, vanilla Rails over gems.

## The Skills

| Skill | What it covers | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| [`rails-best-practices-core`](skills/rails-best-practices-core/SKILL.md) | Architecture, naming, modeling patterns, REST routing, authorization — the baseline for all Rails work | Automatic |
| [`rails-hotwire-realtime`](skills/rails-hotwire-realtime/SKILL.md) | Turbo Streams/Frames, morphing, Stimulus, ActionCable, presence, optimistic UI, web push | On demand |
| [`rails-jobs`](skills/rails-jobs/SKILL.md) | Active Job design, `_later`/`_now` conventions, Solid Queue, recurring tasks, retry policy | On demand |
| [`rails-migrations`](skills/rails-migrations/SKILL.md) | Safe schema changes, staged rollouts, script backfills, multi-DB/multi-adapter setups | On demand |
| [`rails-security-multitenancy`](skills/rails-security-multitenancy/SKILL.md) | Path-based tenancy, Identity→Session→User auth, scoped lookups, SSRF, CSRF, rate limiting | On demand |
| [`rails-testing`](skills/rails-testing/SKILL.md) | Minitest + fixtures, coverage budget, Turbo/broadcast assertions, multi-tenant test wiring | On demand |
| [`rails-webhooks`](skills/rails-webhooks/SKILL.md) | Outbox delivery, failure classification, delinquency circuit breakers, payload signing | On demand |
| [`dhh`](skills/dhh/SKILL.md) | Review code like DHH would — direct, opinionated, allergic to over-engineering | `/dhh` |

"On demand" skills are marked `disable-model-invocation: true` so they don't bloat every request — invoke them explicitly (e.g. as a slash command) or let the core skill point to them.

### Added in this fork

| Skill | What it covers | Invocation | Origin |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`rails-conventions`](skills/rails-conventions/SKILL.md) | Wiring the framework enforces by silence (Zeitwerk, helper inclusion, view-context collisions), the four pre-commit gates incl. `test:system`, two-sided verification for hand-written guards, and how a generic implement/tdd/review workflow connects to the skills above | Automatic (scoped by `paths`) | Original to this fork |
| [`ruby`](skills/ruby/SKILL.md) | Plain-Ruby style: method ordering, error handling, OOD, modern Ruby, performance | Automatic | [superpowers-ruby](https://github.com/lucianghinda/superpowers-ruby) |
| [`hwc-forms-validation`](skills/hwc-forms-validation/SKILL.md), [`hwc-navigation-content`](skills/hwc-navigation-content/SKILL.md), [`hwc-realtime-streaming`](skills/hwc-realtime-streaming/SKILL.md), [`hwc-media-content`](skills/hwc-media-content/SKILL.md), [`hwc-ux-feedback`](skills/hwc-ux-feedback/SKILL.md), [`hwc-stimulus-fundamentals`](skills/hwc-stimulus-fundamentals/SKILL.md) | Hotwire problem-specific guides (forms, navigation, streams, media, loading states, Stimulus basics), each with a `references/` set of worked articles | Automatic | superpowers-ruby, which took them from [Hotwire Club](https://github.com/TheHotwireClub/hotwire_club-skills) |

The six `hwc-*` skills and `ruby` are not 37signals material; they are vendored here so one clone gives a complete Rails set. Licenses and the Hotwire Club terms note are in [`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

## Installation

### Claude Code

Copy the skills you want into your personal or project skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marckohlbrugge/37signals-skills.git

# Personal (all projects)
cp -R 37signals-skills/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/

# Or per-project
cp -R 37signals-skills/skills/* your-app/.claude/skills/
```

Then ask for a review with `/dhh`, or just write Rails code — the core skill activates automatically.

### Cursor

```bash
# Per-project
cp -R 37signals-skills/skills/* your-app/.cursor/skills/
```

### Codex

Copy the skills into your global Codex skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marckohlbrugge/37signals-skills.git
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
cp -R 37signals-skills/skills/* ~/.agents/skills/
```

Codex can invoke skills explicitly with `$skill-name` (for example, `$dhh`) or automatically when a task matches the skill description. Restart Codex if the new skills do not appear.

### Other agents

Each skill is a plain `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter ([Agent Skills format](https://agentskills.io)). Most SKILL.md-compatible tools can load them as-is, or paste the contents into your system prompt / rules file.

### Staying up to date

Clone the repo somewhere permanent and symlink instead of copying:

```bash
ln -s "$(pwd)/37signals-skills/skills/"* ~/.claude/skills/
```

For Codex:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
ln -s "$(pwd)/37signals-skills/skills/"* ~/.agents/skills/
```

Then `git pull` to get updates.

## The Guide

The skills are distilled from a longer-form reference covering ~35 topics, kept in [`guide/`](guide/). It was extracted from analyzing 265 pull requests in 37signals' Fizzy codebase — not just the final code, but the reviews, trade-offs, and iterations that led to it.

## Quick Start: The 37signals Way

1. **Rich domain models** over service objects
2. **CRUD controllers** over custom actions
3. **Concerns** for horizontal code sharing
4. **Records as state** over boolean columns
5. **Database-backed everything** (no Redis)
6. **Build it yourself** before reaching for gems
7. **Ship to learn** - prototype quality is valid
8. **Vanilla Rails is plenty** - maximize what Rails gives you

## Important Caveats

**LLM-Generated Content**: This guide and these skills were largely produced by an LLM (Claude) analyzing source code, PR descriptions, and code snippets. There may be hallucinations or inaccuracies. Take everything with a grain of salt and verify against actual implementations.

**Code License**: Code examples extracted from Fizzy are licensed under the [O'Saasy License](https://osaasy.dev). Please review that license before using code snippets in your projects.
